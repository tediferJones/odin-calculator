# odin-calculator
This is the calculator project from The Odin Project

This calculator is not entirely accurate, it does not follow the correct order of operations, but if inputed correctly should yield the correct result.

The calculator allows a maximum of 12 characters for input and output so that digits do not overflow the display.  It should keep track of irrational or repeating numbers, for example (1/3)*3 will yield 1 not 0.999999999999.

The Clear function will completely reset the calculator, while the delete button will only remove the last character.

Keyboard support is only for number input at the moment.
